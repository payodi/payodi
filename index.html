<p> Unusual <br>
They say strange fascination, infatuation <br>
A lunatic <br>
Call me what suits your taste, I just wanna taste <br>
And I've always heard it's what's inside that counts <br>
Cause my insides are red <br>
And yours are too <br>
And the red on my face <br>
Is matching you <br>
And goodness you're bleeding <br>
What a wonderful feeling <br>
You're down and you're pleading <br>
My head is just reeling <br>
The Red means I love you <br>
Tasting your blood means I love you <br>
The Red means I love you <br>
The Red means I love you <br>
Unfortunate <br>
They say such a shame, I turned out this way <br>
A maniac <br>
Well, yeah I get manic when I cause a panic <br>
And of course I'm excited when I see you around <br>
Cause my insides are red <br>
And yours are too <br>
And the red on my face <br>
Is matching you <br>
And goodness you're bleeding <br>
What a wonderful feeling <br>
You're down and you're pleading <br>
My head is just reeling <br>
The Red means I love you <br>
Tasting your blood means I love you <br>
The Red means I love you <br>
The Red means I love you <br>
You leave me high and dry <br>
A rush comes to my mind <br>
At the drops <br>
Of blood you leave behind <br>
Run as you might, my love will never, ever <br>
Stop <br>
Cause my insides are red <br>
And yours are too <br>
And the red on my face <br>
Is matching you <br>
And goodness you're bleeding <br>
What a wonderful feeling <br>
You're down and you're pleading <br>
My head is just reeling <br>
The Red means I love you <br>
Tasting your blood means I love you <br>
The Red means I love you <br>
The Red means I love you <br>
The Red means I love you <br>
Tasting your blood means I love you <br>
The Red means I love you <br>
The Red means I love you </p>
